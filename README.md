# A Star Wars CYOA
Since there's a noticable lack of CYOA's for star wars, I decided I'd make one!
I (Weigurde, the operator of this account) forked the actual html from another CYOA project and helped adapt it to Star Wars, but most of the writing in it was done by my brother, Minoke.
This is a *rolling release,* and you shouldn't expect:
- This CYOA to look very great*
- This CYOA to be very formal or have a consistent tone
- This CYOA to be very well made in general
- Not having to deal with bugs

Hovever, if you're looking for a version with usually less bugs, you can check out the releases tab on the left.
Otherwise, if you just want to use the CYOA as it was last updated, you can either [clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository), or check out [the website.](https://swcyoa.github.io)
